      "I retained Blottman Law, represented by Leslie Rivas, for a Highway Traffic Act, s.78.1(1) – Driving with Hand-Held Communication Device charge. On the first day of proceedings, Ms. Rivas successfully had the ticket withdrawn. This meant no loss of demerit points, no licence suspension, nothing on my record, and over $200 saved compared to paying the fine, while also sparing me long-term insurance implications and added stress. Ms. Rivas explained the potential consequences clearly, guided me through the process with confidence, and delivered excellent results. I strongly recommend her and Blottman Law to anyone facing traffic charges in York Region or across Ontario.",

// FAQ — the biggest objection handles for traffic-ticket defence.
export const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is it even worth fighting my ticket?",
    a: "Almost always. Paying a ticket is a guilty plea — it adds demerit points and can raise your insurance for years. We often resolve charges for less than the long-term cost of paying.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to go to court?",
    a: "In most cases, no. As your licensed paralegal we attend court on your behalf. Most clients never appear.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "Fixed, upfront pricing quoted before we start — no hourly surprises. Most clients save more on insurance than the fee itself.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a traffic ticket increase my insurance?",
    a: "Insurance consequences vary depending on the type of offence, your driving history, and your insurer. Before paying a ticket, it may be beneficial to understand the potential impact and explore your available options.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are my actual chances?",
    a: "We give you an honest read on your first call — no false promises. If we don't think we can help, we'll tell you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can you help?",
    a: "Send us a message today and we'll review your charge and call you back. The sooner we start, the more options you have.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle parking tickets or other ticket types?",
    a: "No. We handle traffic and Highway Traffic Act matters only, including speeding, careless driving, stunt driving, and similar charges. We do not handle parking tickets or any other ticket type outside the HTA.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you serve only Ontario, or other Canadian provinces too?",
    a: "Ontario only. As a licensed Ontario paralegal, our services are limited to charges under Ontario's Highway Traffic Act.",
  },
