// 1. Say something useful when her line did not pick up. TwiML placed after a

//    the no-answer message can live.
//
// 2. Record the numbers that make call measurement possible. DialCallDuration
//    is the real conversation length, separate from the total call, which
//    includes the greeting and the ringing. Google only ever sees the total,
//    which is why the 45-second conversion threshold has to be re-derived from
//    these logs rather than guessed at. `From` plus the call start time is also
//    exactly the key that call-based offline conversion import needs, and it is
//    the half `call_view` cannot give us.
